# JATE Text Editor

## Description

This web text editor enables users to write text in the application and save it for later use. This single page application meets the PWA criteria and features a number of data persistance techniques that serve as redundancy in case the options are not supported by the browser or the browser is offline. Users are also able to install the application onto their machine, and utilise it away from their browser. This application has been deployed to Render. In this project I was able to learn more about Progressive Web Applications and how to implement methods for storing and retrieving data.
